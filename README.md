# ClassElections
CLASS ELECTIONS is a app developed using java and firebase.
The traditional method of conducting elections is no more of use
This app can work with multiple devices and is best computable with Android os version 6+
Recylcer view,linear view is used with constarint layout 
The app is bundled with result monitor app ( you could check my repo for that /Akashjammi
the result monitor app is like a faculty side view of results.
You could check for voters list,live data ,add authentication in that.
thanks.
